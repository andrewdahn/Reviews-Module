> Reviews microservice for Adidas website clone FEC

This repository contains a clone of the header, navbar, and live-search elements on Adidas.com, as they appeared in November 2018. These components are written as fully modular microservices, which can be seamlessly combined with other components to create a full Adidas.com product-page clone.
